# AI Content Generator - Technical Documentation

## 1. Architecture Overview

The application follows a modern full-stack architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Frontend Architecture
- **Next.js App Router**: Implements client-side routing and server components
- **React Query**: Manages server state and caching
- **Component Structure**:
  - `/app/*`: Page components and routing
  - `/components/*`: Reusable UI components
  - `/hooks/*`: Custom hooks for data fetching and state management
  - `/lib/*`: Utility functions and API service

### Backend Architecture
- **NestJS Framework**: Modular architecture with dependency injection
- **Key Modules**:
  - `AuthModule`: Handles authentication and user management
  - `PostsModule`: Manages blog post CRUD operations
  - `GenerateModule`: Interfaces with OpenAI for content generation
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with TypeORM for data persistence
- **Caching**: Redis for improved performance
- **Logging**: Winston for structured logging

### System Flow
1. User authenticates via JWT-based authentication
2. Frontend makes API calls through React Query hooks
3. Backend validates requests and manages business logic
4. Data is persisted in PostgreSQL and cached in Redis
5. Content generation requests are processed through OpenAI

## 2. Tech Stack & Choices

### Frontend
- **Next.js**: Chosen for its robust routing, server components, and SEO benefits
- **React Query**: Provides powerful caching and server state management
- **Tailwind CSS**: Enables rapid UI development with utility-first approach
- **shadcn/ui**: Offers high-quality, customizable components
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and better developer experience

### Backend
- **NestJS**: Provides scalable, enterprise-grade architecture with TypeScript
- **PostgreSQL**: Reliable, ACID-compliant database with JSON support
- **TypeORM**: Type-safe database operations with migration support
- **Redis**: In-memory caching for improved performance
- **Winston**: Structured logging for better observability

### Development Tools
- **ESLint & Prettier**: Code quality and formatting
- **Jest**: Unit testing framework
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent environments

## 3. Deployment Strategy

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Redis caching for frequently accessed data
   - React Query client-side caching
   - Static page generation where applicable

2. **Database Optimization**:
   - Indexed queries for faster lookups
   - Efficient data modeling with proper relations
   - Connection pooling for better resource utilization

3. **API Efficiency**:
   - Rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Response compression
   - Efficient error handling

### Scalability Considerations
1. **Horizontal Scaling**:
   - Stateless application design
   - Load balancer ready
   - Containerized deployment

2. **Database Scaling**:
   - Read replicas for heavy read operations
   - Connection pooling
   - Efficient indexing strategy

3. **Monitoring & Maintenance**:
   - Structured logging with Winston
   - Error tracking and monitoring
   - Health check endpoints

## 4. Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: State Management
**Problem**: Complex state management between post generation and saving.
**Solution**: Implemented React Query for server state management, providing automatic cache invalidation and refetching.

### Challenge 2: Authentication
**Problem**: Secure user authentication with token management.
**Solution**: JWT-based authentication with secure token storage in both localStorage and cookies for redundancy.

### Challenge 3: Performance
**Problem**: Slow post retrieval and generation.
**Solution**: 
- Implemented Redis caching
- Optimized database queries
- Added client-side caching with React Query

### Challenge 4: Content Generation
**Problem**: Handling OpenAI API rate limits and failures.
**Solution**: 
- Implemented retry logic
- Added proper error handling
- Cached successful generations
